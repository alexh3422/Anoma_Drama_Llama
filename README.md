=============================

## Description

- Anoma Drama Llama is a mood tracker and an online journal with social media features.

- Mood trackers are an important mental health tool. Yet, sometimes it can be difficult to stay on top of tracking your mood every day. What Anoma Drama Llama provides is accountability in the form of your own llama friend who grows in happiness based on how often you track your mood and post. We also provide detailed analytics of your mood entries, so that you can become an expert in your emotion behaviors.

- Everyone needs a place to unload and someone or something to vent to. However, social media outlets aren't suitable for personal journal entries. Most social media is too public and posting your true thoughts can have negative results. Anoma Drama Llama allows users to keep entires private, post them anonymously, or publicly.

## Usage

- New users will be directed to the home page where they can see public and anonymous posts by other users. If you want to access the Llama virtual pet, Journal or Mood features you will need to sign in or create an account. Attempting these options will direct you to the login page where you can enter your credentials or create a new account.

- Llama: If a new account has been created the user will be directed to the "Customize Your Llama" page. You'll need to give your new llama friend a name and choose their color and accessory. Once you have finished you can select "Submit" and you'll be taken to the Llama page where you can admire your new friend and view their happiness level.

  - Llama Happiness: Your llama will become happier and stay happy as long as you keep them fed by posting journal updates and tracking your mood. A journal post will increase happiness by two points, and a mood entry will increase it by one point. Happiness will decrease by one point every two hours.

- Left side panel: This is where you can access your Profile where you can see your entire journal and mood history. You can also access the Llama page or Logout from this side panel.

- All Posts: When you select "All Posts" from the header you will see a feed of all users who have opted to post their entries publicly or anonymously.

- Your Journal: This is where you can post your own journal entries. Every entry must include an emotion tag, title and text body. Select "Add emotions" to choose the mood(s) you'd like to include in your post.

- Your Moods: Here you'll have two charts if you have logged any moods, along with your mood history listed below1. The first chart allows you to order by post, hour, day, week, month or year so that you can get a clear picture of your mood habits at a specific time span. The second shows an overall chart of your moods so you can see what is your most and least commonly logged emotion.
