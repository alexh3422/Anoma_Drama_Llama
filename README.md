# [Anoma Drama Llama](anomallama.herokuapp.com)

=============================

## Description

- Anoma Drama Llama is a mood tracker and an online journal with social media features.

- Mood trackers are an important mental health tool. Yet, sometimes it can be difficult to stay on top of tracking your mood every day. What Anoma Drama Llama provides is accountability in the form of your own llama friend who grows in happiness based on how often you track your mood and post. We also provide detailed analytics of your mood entries, so that you can become an expert in your emotion behaviors.

- Everyone needs a place to unload and someone or something to vent to. However, social media outlets aren't suitable for personal journal entries. Most social media is too public and posting your true thoughts can have negative results. Anoma Drama Llama allows users to keep entires private, post them anonymously, or publicly.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will
ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want
to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred.
Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check
out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not
understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers
to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The
[Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an
industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide
examples on how to run them here.
